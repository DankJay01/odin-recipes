    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These sausage balls are as good as Bisquick sausage balls, but without the carbs and gluten. 
        They are also keto friendly! Eat them fresh out of the oven or refrigerate or freeze for 
        later use.</p>

    <h4><strong>Prep Time</strong></h4>
    <p>15 minutes</p>
    <h4>Servings</h4>
    <p>8 persons</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with 
            parchment paper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin, egg, and baking 
            powder in a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands, a stand mixer, or a food 
            processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized balls (about 1 Â½-inch diameter) and place 
            on the prepared pan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes.

            5 minutes.</p></li>
    </ol>
